# GPT-2/Distilbert text-gen discord bot 

Want to use GPT-2 models to generate text on the go and send it to servers with your discord bot? Look no further, just use this simple template.

### Setup
You are going to need to download your /trained_model folder from training with `aitextgen` and place it in the same directory as this python file. You also will need to install requirements `aitextgen` and `discord`. 

### Use cases
[Add my rap-lyric generating discord bot, DrizzyBot to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=951203643808423937&permissions=534723951680&scope=bot).
